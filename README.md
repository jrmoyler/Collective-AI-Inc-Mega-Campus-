## Project Description

The Collective AI Mega Campus is a purpose-built environment for the full stack of artificial intelligence work: compute infrastructure, research, governance, life-science, manufacturing, bio-energy, and community. The campus integrates six functionally distinct districts within a modified hex-grid street network, targeting 150 MW peak electrical capacity, 24 MWdc on-site solar, and 40 MW / 160 MWh battery storage.

This repository provides:

- **`viewer/`** — a real-time, AAA-grade **interactive WebGL campus** (Three.js) you can demo from a single URL — orbit, first-person walk, and a cinematic auto-tour
- **`unreal/`** — a real **Unreal Engine 5.4 C++** project scaffold (data-driven, walkable) for the long-term, game-engine-grade build
- **`data/facilities.json`** — authoritative master data for all 30 buildings, 6 districts, roads, water features, solar arrays, and wind turbines
- **`scripts/parse_dossier.py`** — re-generates and validates `facilities.json` from embedded source constants
- **`scripts/render_scene.py`** — produces 4 presentation-quality renders using a custom isometric + perspective rasterizer (matplotlib/numpy, no Blender required)
- **`scripts/run_pipeline.sh`** — orchestrates the complete pipeline in a single command

---

## Live Interactive Viewer (AAA Demo)

The `viewer/` directory is a self-contained, real-time 3D experience built on **Three.js r185** (vendored locally — no CDN dependency) and deployed on Vercel. It is the **instant, link-and-walk demo** for investor presentations: open the URL and you are standing in the campus.

**Run it locally:**

```bash
npm run serve          # serves on http://localhost:8080
# then open  http://localhost:8080/viewer/
```

**What it does:**

- **Three view modes** — **Orbit** (cinematic fly-around), **Walk** (first-person WASD + mouselook with building collision, so it feels like you are really there), and **Cinematic** (a hands-off ~80-second auto-tour through the landmark buildings — perfect for pitch playback).
- **A living campus** — instanced pedestrians on the sidewalks, vehicles driving the road network, swaying trees, drifting drones, and street lamps that switch on at night.
- **AAA rendering** — ACES Filmic tonemapping, Unreal-style bloom, PBR building materials with PMREM reflections and emissive window grids, a full day/night system with a gradient sky dome, sun/moon, drifting clouds and a twinkling starfield.
- **Procedural ambient audio** — a synthesized soundscape (wind, distant city hum, birds by day, crickets by night, footsteps while walking) — entirely Web Audio, no asset files.
- **Pitch-ready UI** — cinematic intro card, district filter, building directory, live minimap, and per-building info panels.

**Controls (Walk mode):** `W A S D` / arrows to move · mouse to look · `Shift` to sprint · `Esc` to release the cursor · `M` to mute audio.

**Viewer architecture** (`viewer/lib/`):

| Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `world.js` | Single source of truth — 30 facilities, district palette, world bounds, road network, footprint collision helpers |
| `cameras.js` | Camera director — orbit / first-person walk / cinematic spline tour |
| `population.js` | Instanced pedestrians, vehicles, trees, lamps, drones |
| `environment.js` | Ground, road network, sidewalks, plazas, parks, water, fog |
| `buildings.js` | PBR material enhancement, window emissive grids, env reflections |
| `sky.js` | Day/night sky dome, sun/moon, clouds, starfield |
| `audio.js` | Procedural Web Audio ambient soundscape |
| `main.js` | Scene orchestration, render loop, UI wiring |

---

## Unreal Engine 5 Track (`unreal/`)

A real, idiomatic **UE 5.4 C++** project scaffold for the game-engine-grade build. It is **data-driven from the same 30 facilities** (`unreal/Content/Data/Facilities.csv` → `DT_Facilities`) and walkable out of the box. This track is built and packaged locally in the Unreal Editor — see **`unreal/README.md`** for exact build steps.

| Class | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `ACampusGameMode` | Default pawn / controller / HUD wiring |
| `ACampusPlayerCharacter` | First/third-person walker, Enhanced Input (move/look/sprint/interact) |
| `ACampusBuilding` | Data-driven building actor sized from an `FFacilityRow` |
| `ACampusDirector` | Spawns one building per `DT_Facilities` row at the converted location |
| `UCampusHUDWidget` | UMG base for the building-info panel |

> Note: the UE project uses honest placeholder volumes; the production meshes come from importing the existing GLBs in `assets/glb/buildings/` via Interchange/glTF (documented in `unreal/README.md`). It requires UE 5.4 and is **not** the instant web demo — that is the `viewer/`.

```

---

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repo-url> Collective-AI-Inc-Mega-Campus-
cd Collective-AI-Inc-Mega-Campus-
```

### 2. Install Python dependencies

Minimum (renders only):

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

Full pipeline (includes GLB generation):

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib trimesh scipy pygltflib
```

Optional quality-of-life additions:

```bash
pip install pillow tqdm colorama
```

### 3. (Optional) Install Blender

Download Blender 4.x from [blender.org](https://www.blender.org/download/) and ensure
`blender` is on your `PATH` for Blender-based rendering.

---

## Quick Start

### Run the full pipeline (renders only, no Blender required):

```bash
./scripts/run_pipeline.sh --renders
```

### Run specific steps individually:

```bash
# Validate data and print campus statistics
python3 scripts/parse_dossier.py --validate --summary

# Render all 4 views
python3 scripts/render_scene.py --view all

# Render a single view
python3 scripts/render_scene.py --view hero
python3 scripts/render_scene.py --view dusk
python3 scripts/render_scene.py --view overview
python3 scripts/render_scene.py --view ground
```

### Run the complete pipeline (including GLB generation):

```bash
./scripts/run_pipeline.sh
```

---

## Pipeline Steps

The pipeline has 4 stages, all orchestrated by `run_pipeline.sh`:

### Step 1 — Data Validation (`parse_dossier.py`)

Validates `data/facilities.json` against the embedded authoritative source constants
derived from the Master Development Dossier v3. Prints a full 30-building table,
per-district summary, and campus-wide statistics.

```
python3 scripts/parse_dossier.py --validate --summary
```

Flags:
- `--validate` — compare JSON against embedded source data; exit 1 on mismatch
- `--summary`  — print district totals and campus statistics

### Step 2 — Building GLB Generation (`generate_buildings.py`)

Generates one `.glb` (GLTF Binary) file per building using `trimesh`. Each GLB
represents the building massing (box geometry) with correct dimensions and
arch-family materials. Output: `assets/glb/buildings/<id>.glb` (30 files).

*Requires `trimesh`. Skipped automatically if trimesh is not installed.*

### Step 3 — Master Scene Assembly (`build_master_scene.py`)

Merges all 30 building GLBs with the ground plane, road network, water features,
and site elements into a single `collective-ai-mega-campus.glb` ready for import
into a web viewer or game engine. Output: `assets/glb/site/collective-ai-mega-campus.glb`

*Requires `trimesh`. Skipped automatically if trimesh is not installed.*

### Step 4 — Image Rendering (`render_scene.py`)

Produces 4 rendered images using a custom orthographic/perspective rasterizer
built on matplotlib + numpy. No Blender or GPU required.

The renderer implements:
- Custom isometric projection (SW-to-NE, 30° horizontal / 38° elevation)
- Painter's algorithm (back-to-front sort by projected Y)
- 3-face box shading (top 100%, south face 80%, west face 62%)
- Gradient sky backgrounds
- Water features, road network, scattered trees
- Atmospheric fog for ground-level perspective view

## Blender Rendering

For photorealistic renders with global illumination, `scripts/render_scene.py`
includes a complete Blender `bpy` reference implementation in the
`BLENDER_RENDER_CODE` constant at the bottom of the file.

### To use Blender rendering:

1. Install Blender 4.x and ensure `blender` is on your PATH

2. Run the render script via Blender's background Python mode:

```bash
blender --background --python scripts/render_scene.py -- --blender
```

This will:
- Clear the default scene
- Create a ground plane
- Instantiate all 30 buildings as correctly-scaled, correctly-positioned mesh cubes
  with arch-family PBR materials (Principled BSDF)
- Set up an HDRI sky + Sun lamp
- Set camera to the hero isometric position (SW to NE, 38° elevation)
- Render to `renders/hero_view_blender.png` at 4096 × 2304 px

### Extending the Blender render:

The reference code in `BLENDER_RENDER_CODE` is a starting point. To enhance:

- Add detailed geometry from `assets/glb/buildings/` using `bpy.ops.import_scene.gltf()`
- Apply HDRI environment maps for realistic sky reflections
- Add Cycles path-tracing for shadow quality
- Use geometry nodes to populate trees, roads, and water bodies at scale
- Render animation sequences for fly-through videos

---

## Design Decisions and Assumptions

### Coordinate System

Campus coordinates use a metric (m) right-hand coordinate system:
- **X axis:** West (0) to East (1,097 m)
- **Y axis:** South (0) to North (664 m)
- **Z axis:** Ground level (0) upward

Building `position` values are the **centroid** of each building footprint
(centre of the rectangle in plan).

### Building Heights

Floor heights are assigned per architectural family:
- Data bunkers, industrial: 6–8 m floor-to-floor (tall equipment clearance)
- Corporate towers, civic: 4–4.5 m
- Residential, wellness: 3.5–5 m

`height_m` in the JSON is `stories × floor_height_m` (exact per building).

### Gross Area (GFA)

Gross square footage values are sourced directly from the Master Development
Dossier v3. They represent gross building area including all floors, walls, and
mechanical spaces (not net leasable area).

Note: `stories × footprint_ft[0] × footprint_ft[1]` does not always exactly equal
`gross_area_sf` due to partial floors, setbacks, and atria in some buildings.
The `gross_area_sf` values from the dossier are authoritative.

### Isometric Projection

The hero and dusk views use a modified isometric projection:

```
sx = (x - y) * cos(30°)
sy = (x + y) * sin(30°) * 0.42 + z * sin(38°)
```

The 0.42 vertical compression factor produces a visually balanced isometric
perspective that matches the concept rendering orientation (SW camera, NE view).

### Painter's Algorithm

Buildings are rendered back-to-front, sorted by projected screen Y coordinate.
This approximation works well for non-overlapping isometric views of the campus
but does not handle arbitrary occlusion between nearby buildings of very different
heights. For exact occlusion, use the Blender renderer.

---

## Regenerating Data

If you need to update building parameters:

1. Edit `SOURCE_FACILITIES` in `scripts/parse_dossier.py` (the authoritative Python constants)
2. Update the corresponding record in `data/facilities.json`
3. Run validation: `python3 scripts/parse_dossier.py --validate`
4. Re-render: `python3 scripts/render_scene.py --view all`

The JSON file is the runtime data source for rendering. The Python constants
in `parse_dossier.py` are the edit-time source of truth. Keep them in sync.

## Contributing

### Adding new buildings

1. Add an entry to `SOURCE_FACILITIES` in `scripts/parse_dossier.py`
2. Add the corresponding record to `data/facilities.json` (follow the schema of existing entries)
3. Validate: `python3 scripts/parse_dossier.py --validate`
4. Re-render: `python3 scripts/render_scene.py --view all`

### Adding new render views

Add a `render_<viewname>()` function in `scripts/render_scene.py` following the
pattern of existing views, then add the view name to the `argparse` choices and
the `main()` dispatch in that file.

### Code style

- Python 3.11+, typed where practical
- All physical quantities in metres (metric-first); imperial in JSON for cross-reference only
- Use `numpy` for vectorised operations; avoid Python loops over large point arrays

## Futuristic Blender + Web Viewer Regeneration

The current high-fidelity regeneration path is Blender-first:

```bash
# Preferred GLB generation path, creates all 30 buildings and the master campus GLB
blender --background --python scripts/blender_generate_campus.py

# Full pipeline when Python render dependencies are available
source .venv/bin/activate && bash scripts/run_pipeline.sh

# Presentation viewer
python3 -m http.server 8080
# open http://localhost:8080/viewer/
```

Outputs:
- `assets/glb/buildings/*.glb` — one GLB per dossier facility.
- `assets/glb/site/collective-ai-mega-campus.glb` — full campus scene.
- `renders/hero_view.png`, `renders/dusk_render.png`, `renders/district_overview.png`, `renders/ground_level.png` — still presentation set.
- `viewer/` — Three.js/anime.js presentation viewer with camera moves, building focus, district controls, and day/night transition.

### Versions targeted / used

- Blender: generator targets Blender 4.x via `bpy`; this environment blocked Blender package/tarball download with HTTP 403, so the script is committed and ready for any Blender 4.x CLI install.
- Three.js: `0.185.0` / r185, referenced in `package.json` and CDN imports.
- anime.js: `4.4.1`, referenced in `package.json` and CDN imports.

### Hidden-side assumptions

The concept imagery is aerial and front-biased, so rear/service elevations are inferred as consistent wraps of the visible design language: rhythmic fins, luminous glazing strips, roof solar/mechanical equipment, planted terraces for bio/residential uses, and heavier armored facades for data/security/industrial districts.
